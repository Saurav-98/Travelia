# Travelia Landing Page

## -- Highlight Points

- Splitting necessary Css sections into multiple files and importing each one of them into one main file.
- Working on Preloader for the website.

### Preloader

- set a div of size of body
- set an inner div
- save an image to show as loader and center the image from the outer div

- make an animation to go up and down infinite times
- of the inner div create an after element and animate its background property with the same time frame.

- use javascript to add the class remove when the page gets loaded
